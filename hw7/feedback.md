**Problem 1 - Making Your Graph Generic:** 27/30

- Correctness: 18/20
  -2: failed 5x hw6 tests (alphabetic ordering of nodes in graph)
- Style: 9/10
  -1: it would be good to state what K and V represent in the class comment for Graph

**Problem 2 - Weighted Graphs and Least-Cost Paths:** 28/30

- Correctness: 18/20
  -2: shouldn't print total cost of path when no path found. Should use println when printing total cost
- Style: 10/10
  -0: It would probably be cleaner to pull the Comparator out as a private static class - it would clean up the dijkstraSearch() method a lot

**Problem 3 - Testing:** 12/15

-3: it would also be good to test the findPath command for a full path, instead of just the edge cases

**Turnin:** 2/2
