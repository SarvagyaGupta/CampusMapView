# Test correct printing of graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node b to graph1
added node a to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge ab1 from a to b in graph1
added edge bb from b to b in graph1
added edge ab2 from a to b in graph1
added edge ba from b to a in graph1
added edge aa from a to a in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: a b
the children of a in graph1 are: a(aa) b(ab1) b(ab2)
the children of b in graph1 are: a(ba) b(bb)
