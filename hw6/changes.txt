Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

I added a method that helps take in a list of edges with a common label 
and adds it to the graph, so as to make the life of the client easier.

I also added a toString so that the client can see what the graph holds.
